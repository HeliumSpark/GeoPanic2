# Breaking changes

You might have noticed earthwalker doesn't work anymore after updating. TL;DR: Use `make` instead of `go build` to build it.
You also need `node` now. See more info in the readme :-)

PS: You config _might_ also not work anymore, sorry for the "might". If it doesn't, also check the readme.
